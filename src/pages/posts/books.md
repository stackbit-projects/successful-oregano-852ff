## \[Tutorial] Big folder of books for emergencies, disasters, collapses, etc.

#### A compilation of many critical books for emergencies, and how to get them on your phone:

Covering most possible use cases, and emergency situations - this compilation of books is to ensure your total safety, and survival, in case of the general types of emergencies/disasters (such as natural disasters, pandemics, war, and political collapses).

Considering the fact that you might \*\*not have access to electricity in an emergency \*\*- i recommend to get these books on your phone (by following the tutorial below).

*   Q: Why phone?

*   A: Because you can charge your phone "***without electricity"***, using a solar-panel powerbank.

You can get such a powerbank at any electronics store, or online (i.e. on amazon). I recommend to look at amazon to see which one has the best reviews, and get that one.

To do that, go to amazon > search "solar powerbank" > sort by Avg. Customer Reviews.

(Don't forget to choose your local region for cheap shipping <https://www.amazon.com/gp/navigation-country/select-country/> )
