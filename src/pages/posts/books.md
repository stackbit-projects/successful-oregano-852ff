#### A compilation of many critical books for emergencies, and how to get them on your phone:

Covering most possible use cases, and emergency situations - this compilation of books is to ensure your total safety, and survival, in case of the general types of emergencies/disasters (such as natural disasters, pandemics, war, and political collapses).

The compilation weighs 3.2Gb, and the books are meant to be useful in **any/most** emergencies, from first-aid, to natural disasters, to operating a boat, to orienteering on and off land.

Considering the fact that you **might not have access to electricity in an emergency** - i recommend to get these books on your phone by following the tutorial below.

*   Q: Why phone?

*   A: Because you can charge your phone "***without electricity"***, using a solar-panel powerbank.

You can get such a powerbank at any electronics store, or online (i.e. on amazon). I recommend to look at amazon to see which one has the best reviews, and get that one. These are readily available locally, so you don't need to ***buy it right now***; you can probably get one even after the hypothetical emergency, just by going to the electronics store (which might not be possible in certain types of disasters, because of strict lockdowns, or physical danger).

To do that, go to amazon > search "solar powerbank" > sort by Avg. Customer Reviews.

(Don't forget to choose your local region for cheap shipping <https://www.amazon.com/gp/navigation-country/select-country/> )

*   Pro tip: look for over 1000 4.5+ reviews

# How to get the books on your (android) phone:

The folder with the books is a zip archive, it's a format that compresses the files for easier storage, and portability.

![](https://github.com/dewittswymmerr/victor-hugo/blob/pictures/DeepinScreenshot_select-area\_20210120194309.png?raw=true)

All you need to do is "extract" this zip archive to your phone (or to your computer, and then copy the extracted folder(s) to your phone).

**1, Download the zip (it takes a couple hours)**  <https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Z523kC6Km8yeEbjrrGRBKZt7_nLyJMg/view?usp=sharing> .

**2. Extract the folder**

*   On computer:

![](https://github.com/dewittswymmerr/victor-hugo/blob/pictures/DeepinScreenshot_select-area\_20210120195638.png?raw=true)

*   You can now hook up your phone to the computer and transfer the files

![](https://github.com/dewittswymmerr/victor-hugo/blob/pictures/DeepinScreenshot_select-area\_20210120200722.png?raw=true)

On android:

*   Get RAR <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rarlab.rar&hl=en_IN&gl=US> .

*   Using RAR go to the where you downloaded the ZIP (usually it's the Downloads folder)

![](https://i.ibb.co/q92yw2J/Deepin-Screenshot-select-area-20210121090839.png)

*   Select the ZIP by ticking the box on the right, and tap the icon with the "up arrow" ^.

*   To extract tap "OK"

![](https://i.ibb.co/Yc4YHL5/Deepin-Screenshot-select-area-20210121092325.png)

*   When done - you should delete the original **ZIP folder** (**not the new extracted one**), to free up space, as it's no longer needed.

*   Done!

**4.  To read the books get a reader app**

*   i recommend:

Librera <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foobnix.pdf.reader&hl=en_IN&gl=US> .

or

Adobe Acrobat <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.reader&hl=en_IN&gl=US> .

**5.** **Done!**
